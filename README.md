# Utensil Classifer
A Tensorflow based image classifier for eating utensils

Following along with Google Developer's "Machine Learning Recipes" series (https://youtu.be/cKxRvEZd3Mw), this Python application uses the Tensorflow library to classify different images of eating utensils.

To Run:
```
$ cd <project directory>
$ python scripts/label_image.py --image <image destination>
```

Additionally, `label_image.py -h` is an excellent help tool

### TO DO:
- Unit testing
- More robust training data
- Mobile implementation
